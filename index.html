    <h3>Notice and Authorship</h3>
    <p>
        This website is written and maintained by Tenthdragon103 for my LinkedIn profile. To maintain my anonymity for safety reasons, I use my common username rather than my real name and
        will not provide personal contact information. Additionally, GitHub Pages only supports static deployments. So until I can rent a server, this page is limited to basic functions,
        and I cannot do things like sign-ins, cookies, databases, or PHP scripts. For now, this website serves as a portfolio to showcase my work and skills.

    <h3>About Me in CS</h3>
    <p>
        I was first introduce to computers and programming at 7, when I wrote my first HTML and Scratch code. Around 8 I experimented with a Java learning course, which became my favorite
        language. I used my experience in my elementary school robotics club, where I programmed our bot to respond to our user inputs. In highschool I became more interested in creating
        larger and more complex programs than I had before, teaching myself concepts only taught in calculus 3 or higher, and learning formulas for my attempt at creating a 3D animation
        engine. Needless to say the project failed because I tried doing graphics in Java with AWT. However, it only made me want to keep going, so I kept creating new things with different
        styles and languages. See full About Me page <a href="about.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Current Projects</h3>
    <p>
        Source code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/tenthdragon103">GitHub</a> where I keep up with active projects. Unfortunately some of my older code doesn't exist anymore
        because of things like resets or account loss, so I don't have my old Scratch games or Java programs. My largest and most difficult project to date is my
        <a href="wtjdabot.html">War Thunder chat bridge</a>. I also have a list and description of some other projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
