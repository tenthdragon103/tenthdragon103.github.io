            <h3>Notice and Authorship</h3>
            <p>
                This website is written and maintained by Tenthdragon103 for my LinkedIn profile. To maintain my anonymity
                for safety reasons, I use my common username rather than my real name and will not provide personal contact
                information. Additionally, GitHub Pages only supports static deployments. So until I can rent a server, this
                page is limited to basic functions, and I cannot do things like sign-ins, cookies, databases, or PHP scripts.
                For now, this website serves as a portfolio to showcase my work and skills.

            <h3>About Me in CS</h3>
            <p>
                I was first introduced to computers and programming at 7, when I wrote my first HTML and Scratch code.
                Around 8 I experimented with a Java learning course, which became my favorite language. I used my experience
                in my elementary school robotics club, where I programmed our bot to respond to our user inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In high school I became more interested in creating larger and more complex programs than I had before,
                teaching myself concepts only taught in calculus 3 or higher, and learning formulas for my attempt at
                creating a 3D animation engine. Needless to say the project failed because I tried doing graphics in Java
                with AWT. However, it only made me want to keep going, so I kept creating new things with different styles
                and languages. See full About Me page <a href="about.html">here</a>.

            <h3>Current Projects</h3>
            <p>
                Source code can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/tenthdragon103">GitHub</a> where I keep up with
                active projects. Unfortunately some of my older code doesn't exist anymore because of things like resets or
                account loss, so I don't have my old Scratch games or Java programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My largest and most difficult project to date is my <a href="wtjdabot.html">War Thunder chat bridge</a>.
                I also have a list and description of some other projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
