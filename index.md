### CPSC 120

* Lab 8
  In lab 8 we learned about vectors and command line inputs. I liked this lab because both parts one and two were easy.
* Lab 3
  In lab 3 we learned about using functions and input/output functions from the C++ standard library.
* Lab 12
  In lab 12 we learned about the Magick library and how to use it to manipulate images to create a gif.
