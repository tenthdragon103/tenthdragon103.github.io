        The project contains around 7000 lines of code, and on my PC consumes about 7% CPU and 60MB allocated heap at peak usage, and is about 881 MB in size.

    <h3>Creation</h3>
    <p>
        A chat bridge is a popular tool for Minecraft servers, it allows users from Discord to talk to players in-game. A chat bridge on Minecraft is no easy feat, but unlike War Thunder,
        Minecraft has APIs and plugins. I had to be the first to figure out how to interact with the game, how to get data from its undocumented ports, how to write to it. The discord side
        of things was relatively easy, as JDA (Java Discord Api) is well documented and used, but along with that came other issues of managing threads and preventing breakdown of the program
        and creating safeties and checks. Since War Thunder doesn't have APIs or support external plugins, I had to define how to send messages to the game posing as a player, and do other
        functions autonomously, as well as create commands for moderators on Discord to watch the players and make sure they behave and step in if needed. This of course was only a small small
        part of the whole bot, there are many other features.
    </p>
    <p>
        After about 13 version releases of the project I created v2.0.0, where I integrated a website to control features that would otherwise only be accessible by complicated discord commands.
        The website uses the bot to link user's discord accounts and derive from that their level of permissions and what features to display. I wanted to create a site with the strongest possible
        security, so I had to figure out how to tokenize logins and create an API to protect my database, verify token validity and staleness, and sanitize potential malicious inputs. Also using
        the tokens I was able to sign them to users and decode them in my API to minimize database querying and streamline usage, preventing the possible replication of tokens or decoding.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now the bot has reached version 2.2.11 where I created Discord slash command integration for purposes such as moderation on all sides, creating an all-in-one bot comparable to even the largest
        and widely used Discord tools available.
